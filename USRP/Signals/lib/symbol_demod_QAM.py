# Define the symbol_mod module

# baseband symbols:            The symbols array to be mapped into bits

# scheme:                      A string indicating which scheme is adopted (e.g.: "OOK", "QPSK")

# channel_gain                 This is the gain of the channel, channel impulse response is simply modeled as g(t)= 
# channel_gain*delta(t)
