This is an end-to-end example of data generation, modulation, pulse shaping, 
channel simulation, synchronization, and demodulation. Much of this code was
informed by or taken from two sources: 

1. Source code from Dr. Laneman's RF Lab
2. Example code from PySDR (https://pysdr.org/content/rds.html)

An attempt has been made to provide explanation and description of each
step in the signal processing chain, along with plots to graphically illustrate
what is going on. Comments have also been inserted to indicate what future work 
needs to be done.

This framework can hopefully be used to build a functional SDR link. Work has
been started, but not finished, on getting this DSP framework to interface
with USRP SDR and Sidekiq Z2 SDR through their respective software APIs.

Preamble, Data, and Matched Filter Coefficient Generation

The preamble is a special binary sequence used for its advantageous
autocorrelative properties. This means that when it is correlated with
itself, there is exactly one maximum peak, with the surrounding "peaks"
not exceeding a magnitude of 1

The data generated is a random binary sequence of length 256. This number was chosen
arbitrarily.

This data is then assigned a CRC polynomial based on the key below. This key is the "best"
12 bit key for a Hamming Distance of 2. Basically, the key is used as the divisor in a
modulo-2 division operation on the data. The remainder is another polynomial that is then
appended to the data. More explanation to come at the error check in the end.

The matched filter coefficients are used in frame detection. This is a flipped version
of the preamble sequence that is convolved with the received data to generate a crosscorrelation.

Generation of Pulse Train, BPSK modulation

Best guess is that it makes the following signal processing easier. It seems
that clock recovery doesn't work if I don't input a pulse train.

BPSK modulation is here done at the same time as the conversion of bits to
pulses. 0 is mapped to -1, 1 is mapped to 1 --> BPSK

Simulation of Channel

This bit of code simulates the non-idealities that would be present if this
data were to be transmitted over a real wireless channel.

1. Noise:
    Thermal noise in the channel would mean that the energy of each of your
    symbols would be slightly altered, resulting in slightly different sampled values
2. Fractional Delay:
    Since the local oscillators controlling the up/down conversion of your signal 
    (at transmitter and receiver, respectively) will have slightly different phase,
    this will be manifested as some fractional sample delay in your sampled bitstream
3. Frequency Offset:
    Since local oscillators are not perfect, even if the tx and rx LOs are tuned to the exact
    same frequency, there will be some small amount of error between them. In addition,
    since our receiver will be on a satellite moving at some high velocity relative to our
    ground station, there will be some doppler shift that must be accounted for.

Muller and Mueller Clock Recovery

Note: Only works for BPSK, not for other modulation schemes

This is the beginning of the receiver synchronization section
of this code. At this point, the signal would have been received and down-
converted by the receiver. The analog signal will have been converted to
digital IQ data. Present in this IQ data will be the non-idealities 
discussed previously.

This Muller and Mueller Clock Recovery algorithm acts to correct whatever fractional sampling
offset is present in the data. This is technically a digital implementation of a phase locked loop,
so it would be helpful to have some background information on these.

First, the data is interpolated to ensure that the algorithm is able to make a fractional 
delay determination. Next, the algorithm takes in data, continuously tuning a 'mu' parameter 
(representing the fractional delay) until it reaches some lower error threshold. As it operates, 
the algorithm pulls what it believes are the best samples out and into an output array, downsampling
and ensuring that the output contains one sample per symbol.

This algorithm acts in real time, which makes it useful for continuous operation in real systems.

Coarse Frequency Detection and Correction

This coarse frequency detection and correction is for correcting large frequency offsets,
and results in a kind of "ballpark" corrected signal. First, the samples are squared in 
order to "remove the modulation" (covered in https://pysdr.org/content/sync.html Coarse 
Frequency Correction section). An FFT is then run on this data to find the frequency offset 
(which is manifested as a small sinusoid riding on top of the data signal: the magenta in the
plots you have seen). When this frequency offset is found (by taking the maximum argument of the FFT)
it is corrected by multiplying the sample data by the negative complex sinusoid at that frequency.

Costas Loop Fine Freq Correction

The costas loop is a digital implementation of a Phase Locked Loop (like the
Muller and Mueller Clock Recovery Algorithm). The basic principle of a Costas Loop
is that it has two parameters, phase and frequency, that are continuously updated
through an error function. Like the M&M algorithm, it takes some samples to "lock on".
The Costas Loop will continuously track phase and frequency offset, making it suitable
for tracking and correcting for things like doppler shift. Since it can operate with 
more precision than the coarse frequency corrector, it is used for "fine frequency
correction"

Frame Sync relies on a known preamble sequence that is appended to

received data will almost always correspond to the starting index of our

Demodulation // Error Checking

Demodulation is the process of mapping data symbols back to data bits. A
maximum likelihood detection scheme is implemented by making determinations
about decision boundaries and then classifying received symbols based
on these decision boundaries. For BPSK, the decision boundary is I=0.
Anything to the left of I=0 is interpreted as a -1, anything to the 
right is interpreted as a 1. 1 maps to 1, while -1 maps to 0. This
is how the original bits are reconstructed.

Error checking is done using Cyclic Redundancy Check. This basically does
modulo-2 division using a known polynomial key. When the data was initialized
and encoded, the remainder of the mod-2 division operation was appended to the
data. Now, when mod-2 division is done using the same key, the remainder should
be zero.

This is simply an error detecting operation. Forward error correction, which
involves sending redundant data, should be looked into in the future to 
minimize BER.
