- Are we building the antenna? Are just sticking it to the satellite?
- What does integration with the rest of the Cubesat look like?



- 8cm diameter lense
- 1.25 cm wavelenth for 24GHz
- how big each patch and spacing
    - 1/2 lambda spacing
    - 6.4 * 2 = 12.8, so 12 feeds
    - 1D line of 12 antennas
- stuck with SDR as IF generator and make a conersion to 24GHz 
- SDR: analog devices has not devloped a cheap 18GHz or more chip yet
- radiated power of transmitter X radiactivity of _____ = _____
    directiveity
- cubesat link budget? Rehan Baktur?? antennas and propogation magazine
        - SNR how much at rceeiver?
        - shannon capacity
        - bps / hz = log2(1 + SNR) * bandwidth
        - SNR = receive power / receive noise
        - path loss at wavelenth = 125db?
        - increase range = increase power or gain
        - higher gain is directiveity
- start with link budget
    - Gain of a 
    - G = 4 pi * A / (lambda)^2
        - bigger antenna has more laser like

F/D = 0.5, since increasing this makes wider angler, so max 0.5

- what is allowed power wise at certain frequencies
- Look at other missions, cannot violate transmit power level
- ground station power, spectral masks, angular spectral mask, keep these in check to avoid government
    - this jams their receivers
    - could drown out the signals they are looking for

- End goal: Why so much better than PAA?
    - same gain of antenna is proportional to phased array area
    - with lense it limits the number of elements
    - to power a small PAA is a lot of power, 100 elements with 10s of GHz, a beam former is about 100mW per channel on rceeive
        - 10% eficient
    - Power and heat are value propositions
    - sacrifice continuous scan with more discrete beams
    - high data rates need high SNR, high SNR needs high gain antennas, high gain is higher frequecies with higher bandwidths
- Why are we the first to do this?
    - Chisum working on this for 10 years
    - 1. We could not make lens antennas in 1948, now we have 3d printers, advanced manufacturing
    - 2. Computers are much faster at runner optimization algs
    - 3. Fourier transforms: phasedd array allows all cosines at the same time, but you never want this
    - phased array are great, but they are way overcapable of what we need
        - phased array can make ND logo, beam cannot, but who needs an ND logo?
- find ground width?
- Why need beam stearing instead of jsut having ADCS move?
    - Depends on efficiency of ADCS
    - micro second speeds switch beam around
        - quickly switch between pointing at GS and scanning for X data
        - multi look capabilities
- Baseline PAA power levels
    - Assume each channel 150mW on transmit and 100mW on receive, these are widely accepted, find a paper
            - phased array __ lens paper presented in Boston
