Notes for libsidekiq/FPGA
-------------------------

Starting with v4.10.0 of libsidekiq and its associated System Updates, SRFS
(System RF Server) will no longer be released on any platform other than the
Matchstiq S10 / S20 series.  Any concerns, comments and questions can be posted
to the customer's private subforum through the Epiq Solutions Support website.

Alternatives to SRFS include:

  - ERA (https://support.epiqsolutions.com/viewforum.php?f=348)
  - gr-sidekiq (master branch from https://github.com/epiqsolutions/gr-sidekiq)


Known Issues with libsidekiq/FPGA
---------------------------------

o Reprogramming the Sidekiq Stretch's FPGA bitstream does not restore the
  GPSDO algorithm state nor status.

o Sidekiq X4 applications that are transmit-only and use 245.76Msps, 250Msps,
  491.52Msps, or 500Msps as a sample rate require a user to set the sample rate
  for one of the ORX ports (RxC1 or RxD1) to the same sample rate.

o Long transmit QEC calibration times on X4
  Transmit QEC calibration can take up to 24 seconds between 5GHz and 5.5GHz.

o Invalid samples on Sidekiq Stretch after improper app shutdown
  If a libsidekiq application exits (or crashes) without calling skiq_exit() or
  skiq_stop_rx_streaming() (or its variants), the next time Stretch is
  initialized, the I/Q samples are invalid and do not change.  The current
  workaround when using a Sidekiq Stretch and a libsidekiq application
  improperly ends is to reprogram the FPGA from flash.

  *UPDATE*: Applications built against libsidekiq v4.14.0 or later can
  automatically call skiq_exit() at exit and can address this issue whenever
  skiq_exit() is successful.

o Underruns in Packed Mode
  While transmitting in packed and immediate mode, if an underrun occurs, the
  packed data will no longer be aligned.  Underruns must be avoided when running
  in packed mode.

o Stale Sample Data on NVIDIA Jetson TX1 / TX2 / certain Gateworks variants
  With specific sample rates, the received data may be appear to be stale.  This
  can be detected by monitoring the timestamps and ensure that it always
  increments.  UPDATE: This behavior can be mitigated by pinning the process /
  thread that is calling skiq_receive to a single core (e.g. `taskset` from the
  command line or setting the CPU affinity in C/C++)

o X2 / X4 Thunderbolt3 Chassis
  Plugging in the Thunderbolt3 Chassis does not always result in a PCIe link
  between the Kintex UltraScale FPGA and a host platform.  A user may need to
  unplug and plug the TB3 cable in order for the host to rescan the link.  Use
  'lspci -d 19aa:' on a Linux host to see if a connection has been made.

o Hot-plugging
  Hot-plugging is only supported in applications built against libsidekiq
  v4.14.0 and later.  With the introduction of a card manager in v4.0.0, the
  card cache can become stale if a Sidekiq is unplugged or plugged in before or
  after running libsidekiq applications prior to v4.14.0.  It is recommended to
  have all Sidekiq units connected before running any hot-plug incapable
  libsidekiq applications.  Should the card cache become stale, running a
  hot-plug capable application or rebooting the system will correct the issue.

o Extra I/Q Sample Block received using synced trigger source
  When using skiq_stop_rx_streaming_multi_synced() or `skiq_trigger_src_synced`,
  there is a chance that a user will receive one additional I/Q sample block on
  one receive handle than the other streaming handles.  This is understood, but
  not addressed in this release.  It may be addressed in a future software
  and/or FPGA release.  The impact to the user is that for N sample blocks, one
  handle could receive N+1 sample blocks, however all N sample blocks would
  arrive with sample timestamps synchronized if no receive underruns occur
  during streaming.

o Rx filter caching issue after FPGA reprogramming -- ** Resolved in v4.17.1 **
  The Rx filter configuration cache may not be restored after reprogramming the FPGA.
  To workaround this issue, the cache can be restored by tuning the LO
  (skiq_write_rx_lo_freq / skiq_write_tx_lo_freq) twice: once at a frequency
  greater than 3GHz and then once below 3GHz.

Limited Sidekiq X2 Capabilities
-------------------------------

  === RX Sample Rates ===

    Only the following RX sample rate / channel bandwidths (and available
    decimation stages) are supported.  For example, if 50 Msps is available and
    the handle supports decimation by 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64, then 25, 12.5,
    6.25, 3.125, 1.5625, and 0.78125 Msps are also available (starting with FPGA
    bitstream v3.12.0 and libsidekiq v4.10.0).

  A1/A2 only
    - 30.72 Msps Sample Rate / 18 / 20 / 25 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 36.864 Msps Sample Rate / 30.228 MHz Channel Bandwidth

  A1/A2/B1
    - 50 Msps Sample Rate / 41 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 61.44 Msps Sample Rate / 25 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 61.44 Msps Sample Rate / 50 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 73.728 Msps / 30.228 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 73.728 Msps / 60.456 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 100 Msps Sample Rate / 82 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 122.88 Msps Sample Rate / 100 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 153.6 Msps Sample Rate / 100 MHz Channel Bandwidth

  B1 only
    - 245.76 Msps Sample Rate / 100 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 245.76 Msps Sample Rate / 200 MHz Channel Bandwidth

  Decimated handles (default A1/A2)
    - Decimation by 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 supported by default, these
      decimation rates apply to all above supported sample rates

  === TX Sample Rates ===

    Only the following TX sample rate / channel bandwidths are supported.

  A1/A2 only
    - 50 Msps Sample Rate / 41 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 61.44 Msps Sample Rate / 50 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 73.728 Msps Sample Rate / 60.456 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 100 Msps Sample Rate / 82 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 122.88 Msps Sample Rate / 100 MHz Channel Bandwidth
    - 153.6 Msps Sample Rate / 100 MHz Channel Bandwidth

  Note: Additional rates may be available, contact Epiq Solutions for details.
  Additionally, a user can create and configure the radio with their own
  profile.  Refer to the SDK Manual (skiq_prog_rfic_from_file) for additional
  details.

  === Initialization Duration ===

   The procedure to initialize the hardware is slower than desired.

  === TX Timestamp Mode ===

    Certain TX sample rates result in the TX timestamp incrementing at half of
    the configured TX sample rate.  This is caused by the RX sample rate (or
    base RX sample rate in the case of decimation) being configured for half the
    rate of the TX sample rate.  The following configurations result in this
    behavior:

   - RX 30.72 Msps Sample Rate / 18 / 20 / 25 MHz Channel Bandwidth;
     TX 61.44 Msps Sample Rate / 36 / 40 / 50 MHz Channel Bandwidth
   - RX 36.864 Msps Sample Rate / 30.228 MHz Channel Bandwidth;
     TX 73.728 Msps Sample Rate / 60.456 MHz Channel Bandwidth

    Note: Additional rates may be available, contact Epiq Solutions for details.

  === Initialization Duration ===

    The procedure to initialize the hardware is slower than desired.

  === Transmit for B1/B2 ===

    In releases previous to v4.10.0, transmit on B1/B2 can only be used with a
    TX test tone.

    Starting in FPGA bitstream v3.12.0 and libsidekiq v4.10.0,
    transmit on B1/B2 through the FPGA user app (see tx_samples_from_FPGA_RAM.c
    example code) is supported.

    Starting in FPGA bitstream v3.13.0 and libsidekiq v4.13.0, these transmit
    streaming modes are supported:
     - skiq_chan_mode_single:
       - TxA1 only
     - skiq_chan_mode_dual:
       - TxA1 and TxA2
       - TxA1 and TxB1

  === Transmit Calibration ===

    Transmit calibration does not operate with sample rates <= 61.44Msps.  This
    may result in a less than optimal image and DC offset when operating at
    sample rates at or below this limitation.

    Transmit QEC calibration can take up to 24 seconds between 5GHz and 5.5GHz.

  === LO Tuning Resolution ===

    Currently, the LO can only be tuned to 1 kHz boundaries.  If a frequency on
    a non-1 kHz boundary is requested, the actual configured frequency will be
    automatically adjusted to ensure that it falls within the 1 kHz resolution
    required.


Limited Sidekiq Stretch Capabilities
------------------------------------

  === All hosts ===
   - Configurable Rx pre-select filter selection limited in software
   - FPGA partial reconfiguration limited to .bit files


Limited Sidekiq NV100 Capabilities
------------------------------------

     15.36, 16, 20, 21.6667, 22, 23.04, 30.72, 40, 61.44

  === Differing sample rates ===
   - NV100 supports dissimilar rates, where the receivers and transmitters can be
     configured at different rates. The following are supported:
      - Receive rate 1.4 Msps, transmit rate 5.6 Msps
      - Receive rate 11.2 Msps, transmit rate 5.6 Msps

  === RF Receive Bandwidth ===

Software Errata
---------------
For an up-to-date listing of the Software Errata, please visit:

    https://support.epiqsolutions.com/viewtopic.php?f=115&t=2536


Errata SW1
==========

Issue Description:
 The HTG-K800 FMC carrier's flash contents may fail to program successfully
 (~7%). When the flash fails to program in this manner, the user bitstream will
 subsequently fail to configure the FPGA and the fallback FPGA bitstream is
 ignored. If a user encounters this issue, currently the only means of recovery
 is to overwrite the carrier card flash contents using the JTAG pod.

Affected Product(s):
 o Sidekiq X2 PDK (Thunderbolt 3 Chassis)

Affected API Function(s):
 o skiq_save_fpga_config_to_flash

Impact Version(s):
 o libsidekiq v4.2.x
 o libsidekiq v4.4.x
 o libsidekiq v4.6.x

Resolution:
 When using the store_user_fpga, use the --verify command line option to verify
 the bitstream is correct after programming it to flash. In the software API,
 use the skiq_verify_fpga_config_from_flash() function after using
 skiq_save_fpga_config_to_flash() and check that the return code of
 skiq_verify_fpga_config_from_flash() is 0.

Fixed in:
 libsidekiq v4.7.0 is slated to fix this intermittent flash erase / programming
 behavior. However, as with any unattended update procedure, it is still
 recommended that the verification step be performed where critical operations
 are in use.


Errata SW2
==========

Issue Description:
 The expected locations of the fallback (aka golden) and user bitstreams have
 been updated in the HTG-K800 FMC carrier card's flash starting in libsidekiq
 v4.7.0 and later.

Affected Product(s):
 o Sidekiq X2 PDK (Thunderbolt 3 Chassis)

Affected API Function(s):
 o skiq_save_fpga_config_to_flash

Impact Version(s):
 o libsidekiq v4.2.x
 o libsidekiq v4.4.x
 o libsidekiq v4.6.x

Resolution:
 In order to better support FPGA bitstream fallback and to support full-sized
 FPGA bitstreams, it was necessary to change the locations of the fallback and
 user bitstreams.

 The sidekiq_hardware_updater_for_v4.7.0.sh script will take care of flashing
 the fallback and user bitstreams to their new locations (only if needed).

 After the bitstreams are relocated, if an application compiled against an
 impacted version (see above) of libsidekiq uses
 skiq_save_fpga_config_to_flash(), an error will be emitted stating that "golden
 FPGA not present, cannot update user FPGA image".  A user must use libsidekiq
 v4.7.0 or later in conjunction with relocated bitstreams in order to store a
 user bitstream to non-volatile memory.

 If a user wishes to revert the relocation, they may run a
 sidekiq_hardware_updater from a release prior to v4.7.0.


Errata SW3
==========

Issue Description:
 A flash transaction on the HTG-K800 FMC carrier can fail intermittently and
 without detection. A user may see the warning message "Quad SPI operation bit
 needed assertion" emitted, however the software does not react correctly to
 address the warning.

Affected Product(s):
 o Sidekiq X2 PDK (Thunderbolt 3 Chassis)
 o Sidekiq X4 PDK (Thunderbolt 3 Chassis) and Sidekiq X4 PCIe Blade

Affected API Function(s):
 o skiq_save_fpga_config_to_flash
 o skiq_verify_fpga_config_from_flash

Affected Test Application(s) / Utilities:
 o sidekiq_hardware_updater.sh
 o store_user_fpga

Impact Version(s):
 o libsidekiq v4.2.x
 o libsidekiq v4.4.x
 o libsidekiq v4.6.x
 o libsidekiq v4.7.x
 o libsidekiq v4.8.x
 o libsidekiq v4.9.0 through v4.9.3

Resolution:
 Do not use the sidekiq_hardware_updater.sh utility prior to v4.9.4 to upgrade
 or downgrade an X2 PDK or X4 PDK system. Use the updaters and installers from
 the System Update v4.9.4 20190503 or later

 Do not use the store_user_fpga test application prior to v4.9.4 on an X2 PDK or
 X4 PDK system. Use the store_user_fpga test application from the v4.9.4 SDK or
 the run-time/complete installer from the System Update v4.9.4 20190503

 If your application uses either of the affected API functions, you *must*
 update to libsidekiq SDK v4.9.4 or there is a risk of incorrect flash behavior
 (corruption).

Errata SW4
==========

Issue Description:
 Memory allocated for skiq_tx_block_t may not be aligned on a memory page
 boundary.  When a misaligned skiq_tx_block_t is transferred to the FPGA,
 it is mishandled, resulting in corrupt samples inadvertently added to
 the sample block being transmitted.

Affected Product(s):
 o Sidekiq X4 HTG platforms with 8 lane PCIe support (HTG-K800, HTG-K810)
 o FPGA bitstreams >= v3.14.1

Affected API Function(s) / Macros:
 o skiq_tx_block_allocate, skiq_tx_block_allocate_by_bytes
 o SKIQ_TX_BLOCK_INITIALIZER
 o SKIQ_TX_BLOCK_INITIALIZER_BY_BYTES, SKIQ_TX_BLOCK_INITIALIZER_BY_WORDS

Affected Test Application(s) / Utilities:
 o tx_samples, tx_benchmark, xcv_benchmark

Impact Version(s):
 o libsidekiq v4.7.0 through v4.16.2

Resolution:
 Libsidekiq v4.17.0 will page align memory when allocating for Tx blocks.
 By default, a page size of 4K is used, but can be overridden by #defining
 SKIQ_TX_BLOCK_MEMORY_ALIGN.  If an application uses any of the affected
 API functions, it *must* be updated to libsidekiq SDK v4.17.0 or there is
 a risk of incorrect data being transmitted by the FPGA.

Errata SW5
==========

Issue Description:
 When transmitting on timestamps, four samples are erroneously sent when the
 packet is received, regardless of the specified timestamp.  This can be four
 samples from a previous packet, or samples from the current packet.

Affected Product(s):
 o Sidekiq X2 PDK (Thunderbolt 3 Chassis)
 o Sidekiq X4 PDK (Thunderbolt 3 Chassis) and Sidekiq X4 PCIe Blade

Affected Test Application(s) / Utilities:
 o tx_samples, tx_samples_async, fdd_rx_tx_samples, tdd_rx_tx_samples

Impact Version(s):
 o FPGA bitstreams version v3.14.1 through v3.15.1

Resolution:
 If transmit on timestamp is utilized, please use a FPGA bitstream
 with a version prior to v3.14.1 when this defect was introduced, or
 version v3.16.1 and later when the issue was resolved.
