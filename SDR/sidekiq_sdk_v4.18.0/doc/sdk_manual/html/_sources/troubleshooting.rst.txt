Troubleshooting a Sidekiq Installed in a New Host :sup:`*`
==========================================================

The following subsections address common issues when attempting to use a
Sidekiq card in a new host system. If there are any questions on these
steps or if additional problems are encountered, contact Epiq Solutions
support, :ref:`[5] <ref5>`.

Observing The LED State (Sidekiq mPCIe and Sidekiq m.2 only)
------------------------------------------------------------

If the Sidekiq card is not appearing when running the ``version_test``
application, basic hardware functionality can be determined by
monitoring the state of the LEDs on the Sidekiq card. This can be done
independent of the drivers or kernel version.

With the Sidekiq installed in the host system, the host can be powered
on and the 2 LEDs on the card described as User LED #1 (near the edge
of the board) and User LED #2 (towards the middle of the board). These
LED locations are highlighted in Figure 2 of the Hardware User's
Manual.

When powering up the host, LED #2 turn on and quickly off, and then
about a half second later, turn back on. This LED reflects the state
of the FPGA configuration being loaded. At some point, either at the
same time or later during the boot process, LED #1 should also turn
on. This LED reflects the state of the PCIe link. If LED 1 is on, then
the PCIe link has been established successfully. If both LEDs are on,
then there is a good chance that the hardware will enumerate correctly
on the host.

If the LEDs do not behave as described above, contact Epiq Solutions
support, :ref:`[5] <ref5>`, with information on what the behavior of the LEDs are
and the host system being used.

Verifying the Hardware Interfaces Detected in Linux 
----------------------------------------------------

Once the host completes booting into Linux, the USB and PCIe interfaces
(if present) of the Sidekiq card can be detected (independent of kernel
or driver versions). The USB interface can be checked by running ``lsusb``.
The output of ``lsusb`` from the Sidekiq PDK laptop is shown below.
The line highlighted below is a Sidekiq mPCIe card.

Not all host systems connect the USB interface on the miniPCIe or M.2 connector
to the processor. If *lsusb* does not show the Sidekiq card, it is
possible that the host system being used does not have the USB routed
properly. If this is observed, contact Epiq Solutions support,
:ref:`[5] <ref5>`, with information on the host system being used.
Also note that Sidekiq mPCIe and Sidekiq m.2 have USB interfaces whereas
other Sidekiq products do not.

The PCIe interface can be checked by running ``lspci``. The output of
``lspci`` executed on the Sidekiq PDK laptop is shown below, where a
Sidekiq mPCIe card is highlighted.

If the PCIe interface is not present in the ``lspci`` output, contact Epiq Solutions
support, :ref:`[5] <ref5>`, with information on the host system being
used.

If both the USB and PCIe interfaces are detected by Linux properly, then
it is likely that the Sidekiq card will work properly with the host
system.

.. note:: The Sidekiq X2, X4, and Stretch will not be present on the host's USB.

Checking Kernel and Drivers
---------------------------

The Sidekiq drivers are automatically loaded on bootup through either a systemd or init.d script
depending on the host operating system.  In a systemd configuration, the service script is located
at ``/lib/systemd/system/sidekiq.service`` where as the init.d script is located at
``/etc/init.d/sidekiq``. In order for proper behavior, the kernel version used must match the kernel
versions listed in :ref:`Developing for Alternative Host Platforms`. To request an alternative
kernel or further details on driver validation, contact Epiq Solutions support, :ref:`[5] <ref5>`.
