Introduction
************

This document provides the details required to enable a software
developer to develop Linux software applications that will utilize the
Sidekiq SDR. The following topics will be discussed:

-  Overview of the software architecture of Sidekiq
-  Acquiring the prerequisites for developing software applications,
   including the GCC compiler, the libsidekiq Linux userspace library,
   and a text editor for source code editing
-  Building and downloading the suite of test applications that are
   shipped with each Sidekiq PDK
-  Development of custom applications that use libsidekiq
-  Reference documentation for libsidekiq

All documentation and support for Sidekiq is provided through Epiq
Solutions' support website, which can be found at:

Legal Considerations
====================

The Sidekiq is distributed all over the world. Each country has its own
laws governing reception and transmission of radio frequencies. The user
of the Sidekiq and associated software is solely responsible for
insuring that it is used in a manner consistent with the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is used. Many countries, including the United
States, prohibit the transmission and reception of certain frequency
bands, or receiving certain transmissions without proper authorization.
Again, the user is solely responsible for the user's own actions.


Proper Care and Handling
========================

The Sidekiq unit is fully tested by Epiq Solutions before shipment, and
is guaranteed functional at the time it is received by the customer, and
ONLY AT THAT TIME. Improper use of the Sidekiq unit can cause it to
become non-functional. In particular, a list of actions that may cause
damage to the hardware include the following:

-  Handling the unit without proper static precautions (ESD protection)
   when the housing is removed or opened up
-  Connecting a transmitter to the RX port without proper attenuation â€“
   A max input of -10 dBm is recommended
-  Executing custom software and/or an FPGA bitstream that was not
   developed according to guidelines

The above list is not comprehensive, and experience with the appropriate
measures for handling electronic devices is required.

Overview
========

The Sidekiq SDR is a miniature software defined radio platform in the
form of a standards compliant miniPCIe, m.2 (both 3042 and 2280), or FMC card. These form
factors provide the potential for a wide variety of host systems with
various processors. For clarity, the remainder of this document covers
building applications for the Sidekiq PDK system except when otherwise
specified.

Software Architecture
---------------------

A Sidekiq system consists of a Sidekiq miniPCIe, m.2, or FMC card inserted into
a Linux or Windows host platform supporting the Sidekiq form
factor. Additionally, the Sidekiq Z2 consists of a Zynq 7010, which is a self
contained embedded ARM processor running Linux and Xilinx FPGA in the mPCIe form
factor. The Matchstiq Z3u is a fully housed software defined radio consisting
of the Zynq Ultrascale+, running Linux and Xilinx FPGA, a wideband transceiver,
and an integrated GPS.  The Sidekiq miniPCIe or m.2 card combines a Xilinx FPGA and Cypress USB
microcontroller to provide a complete SDR system accessible to the host platform
through PCIe and/or USB. The Cypress USB microcontroller is the FX2 :ref:`[4]
<ref4>`. For the miniPCIe variant of Sidekiq, the FPGA is a Xilinx Spartan 6
LX45T FPGA :ref:`[2] <ref2>`. For both of the m.2 variants of Sidekiq
(traditional, Stretch, and NV100), the FPGA is a Xilinx Artix 7 XC7A50T FPGA :ref:`[12]
<ref12>`. For the Sidekiq FMC card, referred to as Sidekiq X2 or Sidekiq X4, a
FPGA carrier card in the form of the Kintex Ultrascale (KU060 and KU115)
:ref:`[13] <ref13>` is installed in a Thunderbolt 3 chassis for a PDK is
provided. This chassis uses the Thunderbolt 3 interface of a laptop to provide
access to the Sidekiq FMC card. As of Q1 2019, the Sidekiq X2 and Sidekiq X4 are
also supported in the Annapolis Micro Systemsâ€™ WILDSTAR baseboard (WB3XZD) :ref:`[14] <ref14>`
for use in an OpenVPX system.

A Sidekiq signal processing application consists of a userspace software
application running on the host platform, which links against a
userspace library called libsidekiq (as shown in following architecture
figures). The libsidekiq library provides an API for configuring various RF
and baseband parameters, access to various peripherals (temperature sensor,
accelerometer, etc), as well as an interface for transferring data
between the CPU and the FPGA. This data is typically digitized baseband
I/Q samples. Full details of the libsidekiq library can be found in
:ref:`sidekiq_api`.
